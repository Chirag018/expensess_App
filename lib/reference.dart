// textfield --> is used to add text in the particular line 
// elevation --> is used for shadowing the area
// controller --> it is same as onPressed() but it is different than in some case , because we can use it in stateless widget where as onPressed after sometime we need it to change it to statefull widget
// listview --> is a widget which is a combination of column + singlechildscroolview
// listview builder --> it is a subform part of widget which is same as listview widget but it reduces the complexity of our code when the list is to long i.e. when our list contains more than 10 list or more than that then our app's performance will start decreasing,
// listview.builder() is used when we don't know how many elements will be coming where as above one is used when we know the list and list is smaller in size.
// listview.builder() is also useful because it only loads the elements which are visible where as listview loads all the elements even which are not visible which in long run consumes lot of memory and reduces the complexity of our app
// accentcolor --> is the alternative color, it is used for mixing 2 different colors and using their mixture
// theme in our main widget is used to give the same theme to our entire app , so that which ever color we use our theme remains same.
// sizedbox --> it is used to add some space between 2 widgets ,if they are placed one beside another
// where() --> is used to iterate every item in a list and it returns a iterable which can be converted into list by toList().
// Flexfit --> is used to expand our widget in full size i.e. it will occupy all the remaining space available  ,there is also flexfit property in which we can choose if element should be loosely packed or tightly packed.
// expanded --> is similar to flexfit but in this elements will be automatically tightly packed.
